To get started here are some online resources for programming skills in Python and for setting up the required Python development environment.
+ [Coursera "Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python).+ We’ll be using the [Anaconda Python distribution](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/faq.html);+ Along with the [Jupyter notebook with an IPython kernel](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html);+ [Introduction to IPython Notebook](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/core/notebook.html).
+ [IPython notebook exercises](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/catherinedevlin/mpwfw_exercises/blob/master/setup.windows.ipynb).
